vented.py : vented loudspeaker enclosure response calculator

vented.py provides functions that calculate the approximate (model predicted), 
theoretical frequency response of a vented box loudspeaker system. The script 
uses mathematical model analysis results from A. N. Theile and Richard Small, 
as published in 'Loudspeakers in Vented Boxes' and 'Vented Box Loudspeaker 
Systems', respectively.

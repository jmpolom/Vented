1) Finish parameter calculation from characteristics of specific response
2) Move repeatedly calculated values from other param calculating functions 
   into functions
3) Add some console output while script runs, IE: to let the user know its
   working
4) Make sure to update dependent functions or include wrappers for backwards 
   compat
5) Some other test cases?
